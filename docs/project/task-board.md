## Active
| ID | Title | Milestone | Gate | Priority | Status | Owner | Blockers | Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T-000 | <starter task> | M0 | Gate A | P0 | Ready | Unassigned | None | Start worker thread |

## Next Up
| ID | Title | Milestone | Gate | Priority | Status | Owner | Blockers | Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T-001 | <next scoped task> | M0 | Gate A | P1 | Backlog | Unassigned | None | Prioritize during main-thread sync |

## Backlog
| ID | Title | Milestone | Gate | Priority | Status | Owner | Blockers | Next Action |

| T-099 | <future item> | M1 | Gate A | P2 | Backlog | Unassigned | None | Revisit when capacity exists |

## Status Vocabulary
- `Ready`: scoped and unblocked, can start now.
- `In Progress`: currently active in a worker thread.
- `Blocked`: cannot continue until blocker is removed.
- `Review`: implemented, awaiting validation or merge.
- `Done`: complete and integrated.
- `Backlog`: not scheduled yet.

## Update Rules
- At worker start: set target task to `In Progress`.
- At worker end: update status, blockers, and next action.
- If scope changes: create/split tasks instead of overloading one row.
